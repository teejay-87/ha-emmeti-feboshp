## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-31

🎉 **Official Stable Release** — ConnectionManager refactor, adaptive backoff, and connection
diagnostics that resolve the recurring "device deafness" symptom.

This release promotes the `1.3.0-beta.1` work to stable after multi-day validation on a live
device: **17 silent timeouts were auto-recovered over an 8-hour window with 0 command failures,
0 offline events, and ~99.96% connection reuse**, and the manual "kick the device off WiFi"
workaround went unused for days. See the beta entry below for the full architecture detail.

### 📊 Diagnostics (changed since beta.1)

- **Four** connection diagnostic sensors are now **enabled by default** (was two). Added
  `Connection Silent Timeouts` and `Connection Last Error` to the defaults:
  - `Connection State` and `Connection Consecutive Failures` show link health, but
    auto-recovery keeps both at their healthy values during transient "deaf device" events.
  - `Connection Silent Timeouts` is the **only** sensor that surfaces those auto-recovered
    events — without it, a device still going deaf under the hood is invisible.
  - `Connection Last Error` is empty when healthy but is the most useful field for diagnosing
    a problem or filing a bug report.
- The remaining eight diagnostic sensors stay opt-in.

### 🏗️ Architecture

- **Extracted `ConnectionManager`** (`connection_manager.py`) — the connection lifecycle is now
  an explicit state machine (`DISCONNECTED → CONNECTING → READY → BACKOFF`, terminal `CLOSED`)
  that owns the single TCP/telnet session and serialises every command. `api.py` is now a thin
  parser/orchestrator on top of it; public API unchanged.

### 🚀 Reliability (device-deafness mitigations)

- **Reuse window raised to 90 s** (was 25 s) — one TCP session persists across the poll cadence
  instead of churning a fresh socket every minute.
- **Retries dropped from 3 to 1** per command — caps the worst-case connect-storm.
- **TCP RST on error close** (`transport.abort()`) — a failed command drops the socket with RST
  so the device frees its slot immediately instead of waiting out CLOSE_WAIT.
- **Bounded `wait_closed()`** — a misbehaving device can no longer hang the integration on close.
- **Exponential backoff** (5 s → 60 s) after 3 consecutive failures — the manager refuses new
  connections while in backoff, giving the device room to recover.

### 🔧 Logging

- **Structured `(ConnMgr.*)` log prefix** for every state transition, connect attempt, retry,
  close, and backoff event. Scope it via
  `custom_components.4noks_elios4you.connection_manager: debug`.

### 🧹 Code Quality

- Dropped all `# type: ignore` comments; `DataUpdateCoordinator[bool]` and
  `CoordinatorEntity[Elios4YouCoordinator]` are now properly parameterised.
- Removed the unused `check_port()` and `as_diagnostics()` helpers.
- Test coverage at 99% overall (211 tests).

### 📚 Documentation

- README updated with the new architecture, `(ConnMgr.*)` log format, and the four
  default-enabled diagnostic sensors.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

**None** — `api.py`'s public surface is unchanged. Existing config entries, sensors, the relay
switch, and automations keep working without modification.

## [1.3.0-beta.1] - 2026-05-27

🧪 **Beta Release** — ConnectionManager refactor + adaptive backoff to address recurring "device deafness".

Please test this beta on your real device for 2–3 days before it is promoted to stable. The
two new diagnostic sensors enabled by default (`Connection State` and
`Connection Consecutive Failures`) make it easy to confirm the integration is healthy at a glance.

**Full Changelog:** <https://github.com/alexdelprete/ha-4noks-elios4you/compare/v1.2.0...v1.3.0-beta.1>

### 🏗️ Architecture

- **Extracted `ConnectionManager`** (`connection_manager.py`) — the connection lifecycle is now
  an explicit state machine (`DISCONNECTED → CONNECTING → READY → BACKOFF`, terminal `CLOSED`)
  that owns the single TCP/telnet session and serialises every command. `api.py` is now a
  thin parser/orchestrator on top of it; public API unchanged.

### 🚀 Reliability (device-deafness mitigations)

- **Reuse window raised to 90 s** (was 25 s) — the same TCP session now persists across the
  default 60 s poll cadence instead of churning a fresh socket every minute.
- **Retries dropped from 3 to 1** per command — caps the worst-case connect-storm on a flaky
  cycle at ~6 SYNs instead of ~12.
- **TCP RST on error close** (`transport.abort()`) — when a command fails the socket is dropped
  with RST so the device frees its slot immediately rather than waiting out CLOSE_WAIT.
- **Bounded `wait_closed()`** — a misbehaving device can no longer hang the integration on close.
- **Exponential backoff** (5 s → 60 s) after 3 consecutive failures — while in backoff the
  manager refuses to even attempt a new connection, giving the device room to recover.

### 📊 Diagnostics

- **12 new diagnostic sensors** under the device's Diagnostic section: `Connection State`,
  `Connection Consecutive Failures`, `Connection Backoff Remaining`, `Connection Silent Timeouts`,
  `Connection Forced Aborts`, `Connection Reuse Hits`, `Connection Connects Succeeded`,
  `Connection Connect Failures`, `Connection Commands Sent / Failed / Retried`, and
  `Connection Last Error`. `Connection State` and `Connection Consecutive Failures` are enabled
  by default; the rest are opt-in.
- **Downloadable diagnostics** now include a `connection_manager` section with the full
  metrics snapshot.

### 🔧 Logging

- **Structured `(ConnMgr.*)` log prefix** for every state transition, connect attempt, retry,
  close, and backoff event. Target it directly via
  `custom_components.4noks_elios4you.connection_manager: debug` to see manager-only logs.

### 🧹 Code Quality

- **Type-checker cleanup**: dropped all `# type: ignore` comments. `DataUpdateCoordinator[bool]`
  and `CoordinatorEntity[Elios4YouCoordinator]` are now properly parameterised, and the
  Unicode telnetlib3 variants are `cast()` at the assignment site.
- Dropped the no-longer-used `check_port()` method and the unused `as_diagnostics()` helper.

### 📚 Documentation

- README updated with the new architecture, log format, and diagnostic sensors.
- All pre-existing pymarkdown MD032 violations (CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, README.md, and the
  full docs/releases/ history) are fixed — Lint CI is green again.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

**None** — `api.py`'s public surface (`async_get_data`, `telnet_set_relay`, `close`,
`data`, `name`, `host`) is unchanged. Existing config entries, sensors, and automations
continue to work without modification.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-02

🎉 **Official Stable Release** - Recovery script, device triggers, enhanced notifications, and UI improvements

This release includes all improvements from the v1.1.0 beta cycle, bringing automated recovery scripts, device
automation triggers, enhanced recovery notifications with detailed timing, and options flow UI improvements.

### ✨ New Features

#### Recovery Script (Optional)

Configure an optional script that automatically executes when the device stops responding. This enables automated
recovery actions like restarting your WiFi router or power-cycling network equipment.

**Configuration:** In Options flow, select a script entity to run when failures exceed the configured threshold.

**Available variables for script:**

- `device_name` - The configured device name
- `host` - The device IP address
- `port` - The device TCP port

**Example use case:** Configure a script that restarts your WiFi access point when the Elios4you device becomes
unreachable, enabling automatic network recovery.

#### Device Triggers for Automations

Added 3 device triggers to enable Home Assistant automations based on device connection events:

| Trigger | Event | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `device_unreachable` | Network/TCP connection failed | Fires when device cannot be reached on the network |
| `device_not_responding` | Connected but not responding | Fires when device is reachable but telnet commands fail |
| `device_recovered` | Device responding again | Fires when device recovers after a failure |

**Usage:** In HA Automations, go to "Device" trigger and select your Elios4You device to see available triggers.

#### Enhanced Recovery Notifications

Improved repair notifications with detailed timing information:

- **Failure started:** Time when the issue began (locale-aware format)
- **Script executed:** Time when recovery script ran (if configured)
- **Recovery time:** Time when device recovered
- **Total downtime:** Compact format (e.g., "5m 23s", "1h 15m")
- **Persistent notifications:** Survive HA restarts, require user acknowledgment

**Example notification:**

```text
Title: My Elios4You has recovered

Your Elios4You device is now responding again.

Failure started: 14:32:15
Script executed: 14:32:18
Recovery time: 14:37:38
Total downtime: 5m 23s

The recovery script script.restart_wifi was executed.

Please dismiss this notification to acknowledge.
```

#### Options Flow UI Improvements

Rearranged the options flow dialog for better UX:

| Order | Field | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Recovery script | Moved up (right after variables description) |
| 2 | Enable repair notifications | Unchanged position |
| 3 | Failures before notification | Changed from slider to input box |
| 4 | Polling Period | Moved to bottom |

#### Min-Max Validation in Field Labels

All numeric input fields now display their validation ranges:

- TCP port: `(1-65535)`
- Polling Period: `(30-600)`
- Failures threshold: `(1-10)`

## [0.4.0-beta.1] - 2025-12-29

🔧 **Beta Release** - Migrate to telnetlib3 async client

### ♻️ Major Architecture Changes

- **Migrated to telnetlib3 Async Client** ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT - Replaced bundled synchronous telnetlib with telnetlib3 for
  fully async I/O operations. This prevents blocking the Home Assistant event loop during telnet operations.

### 🐛 Problem Solved

**Before (Sync Blocking):**

- `read_until()` could block the event loop for up to 5 seconds per command
- Other integrations, automations, and UI updates would freeze during telnet I/O
- Home Assistant responsiveness degraded during polling cycles

**After (Async Non-Blocking):**

- All telnet I/O operations yield control to the event loop
- Other tasks run while waiting for device responses
- Home Assistant remains responsive during polling

### ✨ New Methods

- **`_async_read_until()`** - Custom async read-until-separator helper for stream-based reading
- **`_async_send_command()`** - Fully async command execution (replaces sync `telnet_get_data()`)
- **`async _ensure_connected()`** - Async connection pooling with timeout
- **`async _safe_close()`** - Async graceful connection cleanup
- **`async close()`** - Public async close method

### 📦 Files Changed

- `custom_components/4noks_elios4you/api.py` - Major rewrite (~80% of file)
  - Removed `E4Utelnet` class (no longer needed)
  - Added async telnetlib3 client (reader/writer streams)
  - All I/O operations now fully async
- `custom_components/4noks_elios4you/__init__.py` - Updated to `await` async `close()` method
- `custom_components/4noks_elios4you/const.py` - Version bump to 0.4.0-beta.1
- `custom_components/4noks_elios4you/manifest.json` - Version bump to 0.4.0-beta.1
- `custom_components/4noks_elios4you/telnetlib/__init__.py` - **Deleted** (bundled sync telnetlib no longer needed)

### 🔄 Migration Summary

| Component | Before (Sync) | After (Async) |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Import | `from .telnetlib import Telnet` | `import telnetlib3` |
| Client | `E4Utelnet()` class | `reader, writer` tuple |
| Connect | `E4Uclient.open()` | `await telnetlib3.open_connection()` |
| Write | `E4Uclient.write()` | `writer.write(); await writer.drain()` |
| Read | `E4Uclient.read_until()` | `await _async_read_until()` |
| Close | `E4Uclient.close()` | `await writer.wait_closed()` |

### ✅ Preserved Features

All existing functionality is preserved:

- ✅ Connection pooling (25-second reuse window)
- ✅ Command retry logic (3 retries, 300ms delay)
- ✅ Race condition prevention via asyncio.Lock
- ✅ Silent timeout detection
- ✅ Same exception handling (TelnetConnectionError, TelnetCommandError)

### ✅ Code Quality

- 100% Ruff compliance maintained
- Net reduction of 680 lines (+194 / -874)
- Removed bundled telnetlib (672 lines)

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

**None**. This is an internal refactor with full backward compatibility.

## [0.3.0-beta.1] - 2025-12-29

🔧 **Beta Release** - Fix device "deaf" issue with connection pooling

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Device "Deaf" Issue** ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT - Implemented connection pooling to prevent socket exhaustion that
  caused device to become unresponsive 50-60 times/day
- **Fixed Socket Exhaustion** - Eliminated double socket usage (check_port + connection) per poll cycle
- **Fixed TIME_WAIT Accumulation** - Connection reuse prevents socket backlog on embedded device
- **Fixed Silent Timeouts** - Added detection for incomplete responses in `telnet_get_data()`
- **Fixed Global Timeout Mutation** - Changed `socket.setdefaulttimeout()` to socket-specific `settimeout()`
- **Fixed Race Conditions** - Added `asyncio.Lock` to serialize telnet operations between polling and switch commands

### ✨ New Features

- **Connection Pooling** - Reuse existing telnet connections for up to 25 seconds
- **Graceful Connection Close** - New `_safe_close()` method with proper buffer draining and TCP shutdown
- **Connection Health Checks** - New `_is_connection_valid()` method validates connection before reuse

### ♻️ Architecture Improvements

- **Removed Redundant Update Listener** - Aligned with ha-sinapsi-alfa by removing manual
  `async_on_unload(add_update_listener())` - `OptionsFlowWithReload` handles this automatically
- **New Connection Management Methods**:
  - `_is_connection_valid()` - Check if existing connection can be reused
  - `_safe_close()` - Graceful close with buffer drain
  - `_ensure_connected()` - Open connection only if needed
- **Refactored `async_get_data()`** - Uses connection lock and pooling, no longer calls `check_port()` separately
- **Refactored `telnet_set_relay()`** - Uses same connection lock to prevent race conditions with polling

### ✅ Code Quality

- 100% Ruff compliance maintained
- Fixed SIM105 linting errors by using `contextlib.suppress()` instead of try-except-pass patterns
- Import optimization with `contextlib` module

### 📝 Technical Details

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The device became "deaf" due to socket exhaustion on the embedded Elios4You device. Each poll cycle opened 2 sockets
(check_port + connection), creating ~120 sockets/hour with 30-second polling. Combined with 2-minute TIME_WAIT
persistence, this overwhelmed the device's limited socket backlog.

**Solution:**

- Eliminated redundant `check_port()` call before each connection
- Implemented 25-second connection reuse window
- Added asyncio.Lock to serialize all telnet operations
- Added graceful socket shutdown with buffer draining
- Added silent timeout detection for incomplete responses

**Expected Results:**
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Sockets per poll | 2 | 0-1 (reuse) |
| TIME_WAIT accumulation | 120/hour | ~2/hour |
| Race condition risk | High | None (locked) |
| Device "deaf" events | 50-60/day | ~0 |

### 📦 Files Changed

- `custom_components/4noks_elios4you/api.py` - Connection pooling implementation
- `custom_components/4noks_elios4you/__init__.py` - Removed redundant update listener
- `custom_components/4noks_elios4you/const.py` - Version bump
- `custom_components/4noks_elios4you/manifest.json` - Version bump
- `.gitignore` - Added build/ directory
